# About Me

## About My Present
I‚Äôm currently part of JTI‚Äôs Graduate Programme, an exciting rotational journey across three departments designed to gain a 360¬∫ view of the company, exploring different business and technology fields.

**Rotation 1: Business Technology Solutions:**
======
  In my first rotation, I contributed to the **Digital Consumer Program for Reduced Risk Products** ‚Äî a digital ecosystem designed to engage consumers through tailored digital experiences. My role exposed me to diverse business perspectives, from Asian to European markets, adapting solutions to different consumer needs and cultural contexts.
  Key contributions:

Became a **subject-matter expert** in the new version, ensuring local marketing teams understood its enhanced capabilities. Served as SPOC between the Global Engagement team and local markets, while also proposing improvements to streamline migration and enrich future feature development.

  - **AI & Productivity Initiative**: Identified efficiency gaps in BTS daily routines and tested Microsoft Copilot and Power Automate use cases. Produced a structured evaluation report, highlighting where AI added the most value, and delivered a tailored presentation to my manager on how to embed AI-driven solutions into workflows. This project gave me practical insight into **AI adoption for workplace productivity**.

**Rotation 2: Data Innovation & Analytics:**
======
  Currently, I‚Äôm acting as a **Business Analyst** within two **agile (scrum) teams** ‚Äî the Marketing Automation team and the Customer Data Platform (CDP) team. My role bridges business needs and technical execution, translating initiatives into clear requirements and working with **Jira** to streamline collaboration and ensure alignment across teams on tasks, bugs, and initiatives.

    - Served as the **right hand to the Product Owner**, defining product goals and backlog items while ensuring alignment between global business needs and development efforts.

  - **Customer Data Platform**:
    - Supported local marketing teams in data segmentation and targeting, running SQL queries in **Treasure Data** to extract insights and build audience segments tailored to campaign needs.
    - Partnered with developers to **refine data schemas** and ensure **business requirements were translated** into reliable solutions.

## About my past
Born and raised in Granada, I studied a **Double Degree in Computer Engineering and Business Administration** at the University of Granada.

During my studies, I broadened my horizons with two exchange programs:

    - URJC: Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid, Spain)
    - BME: University of Technology and Economics (Budapest, Hungary)

My final project in Computer Engineering was the prototype of an application for professional physiotherapists in soccer, designed to centralize and analyze players‚Äô health data to support informed decisions on injuries, recovery, and rehabilitation.

## About my Future
My third and final rotation will be in the **Technology & Innovation** department, where I‚Äôll explore cutting-edge tools and evaluate their potential value for the company, employees, and consumers.

Beyond the programme, I aim to take on roles that bridge technology and business, leveraging my dual academic background and international perspective to drive meaningful impact.

## Passion and Purpose
I‚Äôm passionate about joining teams that foster innovation, autonomy, and continuous learning.
I want to contribute to purpose-driven projects, especially those aligned with sustainability and the circular economy ‚Äî values I practice daily.

I strongly believe in the power of reusing and repairing over replacing. My advocacy for the **second-hand market and circular economy** reflects not only my professional values but also my personal lifestyle.
