👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Research Scientist at Sakana AI.

🔬 My research interests are in Openended Learning using large foundation models!

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

# Selected Experience

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently, I am working as a **Research Scientist** at Sakana AI exploring how to develop an *openended algorithm to coevolve a population of agents and the environment they are in*. \
Before this, I explored latent reasoning by combining diffusion models with large language models and how to train a process reward model for training multimodal large language models as UI-Agents.

During my final year at college I was working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.

Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
Moreover, I try my best to be a reviewer at top conferences that people don't hate. I even got an [outstanding reviewer award](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/ProgramCommittee) at the CVPR 2025 conference!
