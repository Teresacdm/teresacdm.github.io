## About my past
I was born and raised in **Granada**, where I pursued a **Double Degree in Computer Engineering and Business Administration** at the University of Granada. This path gave me a unique perspective at the intersection of technology and business, strengthening both my analytical and problem-solving skills.

I expanded my international outlook through **exchange programs** at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid, Spain) and BME: University of Technology and Economics (Budapest, Hungary), experiences that broadened my cultural adaptability and academic depth.

Throughout my studies, I developed strong technical versatility, working with languages such as **Python, Java, Ruby, HTML, SQL**, and tools like **MongoDB, Django, KNIME, and Flet**. These projects allowed me to apply my skills in real-world contexts:

  - **Final Degree Project**: Designed and developed a **Flet application with Python backend** for professional football physiotherapists, enabling efficient player health data registration and visualization to support decision-making on injuries and recovery. Being evaluated by the jury with a 9.5. 

  - **Business Intelligence**: Used **KNIME and Python** to analyze datasets, performing clustering on Spanish population data to study political opinion segmentation.

  - **Web Applications Development**: Built an e-commerce platform with **Python, HTML, MongoDB, and Django**, gaining hands-on experience in **full-stack** web development.

  - **Object-Oriented Programming**: Created a maze-based game in **Java and Ruby**, applying object-oriented design principles, probability, and logic-based mechanics.

  - **Marketing & Media Projects**: Explored brand personality creation and media strategies through academic projects, even developing fictional start-ups to which I created a whole business plan and pitched it to a jury. I also strongly engaged in analyzing real-world campaigns to understand how businesses shape consumer engagement.


I successfully completed this challenging double degree in the planned five years, graduating with both technical and business expertise that I continue to build on today.


## About my Future
Looking ahead, I am eager to continue expanding both my **business knowledge and technical expertise**, building on the foundation of my rotational experience. My upcoming third rotation in the **Technology & Innovation** department will give me the opportunity to explore emerging tools and evaluate their potential impact for employees, consumers, and the business as a whole.

Beyond technical growth, I value the global perspective I have gained at JTI ‚Äî **working with colleagues from diverse cultures and backgrounds** has been one of the most **enriching** aspects of my journey so far. I believe that a company‚Äôs strength lies in harnessing these different perspectives, and I actively foster strong team relationships, as understanding people is key to working better together.

At the heart of my career aspirations is a passion for driving projects that combine **innovation, purpose, and sustainability**. I feel strongly engaged with the principles of the circular economy, and I believe the **second-hand market** is one of the key pillars of sustainability. My goal is to keep growing in roles that bridge technology and business, while contributing to solutions that not only create value but also make a **positive impact** on the world.
